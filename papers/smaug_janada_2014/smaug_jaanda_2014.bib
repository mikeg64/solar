  Abstract                 = {We perform numerical simulations of impulsively generated Alfv�n waves in an isolated solar arcade, which is gravitationally stratified and magnetically confined. We study numerically the propagation of Alfv�n waves along the magnetic structure that extends from the lower chromosphere, where the waves are generated, to the solar corona, and analyze the influence of the arcade size and the width of the initial pulses on the wave propagation and reflection. Our model of the solar atmosphere is constructed by adopting the temperature distribution based on the semi-empirical VAL-C model and specifying the curved magnetic field lines that constitute the asymmetric magnetic arcade. The propagation and reflection of Alfv�n waves in this arcade is described by 2.5-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic equations that are numerically solved by the FLASH code. Our numerical simulations reveal that the Alfv�n wave amplitude decreases as a result of a partial reflection of Alfv�n waves in the solar transition region, and that the waves that are not reflected leak through the transition region and reach the solar corona. We also find the decrement of the attenuation time of Alfv�n waves for wider initial pulses. Moreover, our results show that the propagation of Alfv�n waves in the arcade is affected by the spatial dependence of the Alfv�n speed, which leads to phase mixing that is stronger for more curved and larger magnetic arcades. We discuss the processes that affect the Alfv�n wave propagation in an asymmetric solar arcade and conclude that besides phase mixing in the magnetic field configuration, the plasma properties of the arcade, the size of the initial pulse, and the structure of the solar transition region all play a vital role in the Alfv�n wave propagation.},

  Abstract                 = {We present magneto-hydrodynamic simulation results for heterogeneous systems. Heterogeneous architectures combine high floating point performance many-core units hosted in conventional server nodes. Examples include Graphics Processing Units (GPU's) and Cell. They have potentially large gains in performance, at modest power and monetary cost. We implemented a magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulation code on a variety of heterogeneous and multi-core architectures --- multi-core x86, Cell, Nvidia and ATI GPU --- in different languages, FORTRAN, C, Cell, CUDA and OpenCL. We present initial performance results for these systems. To our knowledge, this is the widest comparison of heterogeneous systems for MHD simulations. We review the different challenges faced in each architecture, and potential bottlenecks. We conclude that substantial gains in performance over traditional systems are possible, and in particular that is possible to extract a greater percentage of peak theoretical performance from some systems when compared to x86 architectures.},
